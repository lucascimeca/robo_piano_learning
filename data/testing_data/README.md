Testing data for the piano experiments. The data for testing was generated during training, depending on the linear or GP-fit of the robot at that point. As such, the data does not present any particular order and the attempted control parameters are not equally spaced. The folder contains over 7000 samples for testing. For an example of the use of this folder please see the script at "src/scripts/virtual_run.py"
